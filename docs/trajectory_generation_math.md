## Mathematical Principles of Trajectory Generation

In this project, I implemented trajectory generation for path planning using a seventh-order polynomial interpolation scheme to approximate minimum snap trajectories. The following section outlines the core mathematical concepts and the detailed construction of the matrix system I used to solve for the polynomial coefficients.

### Polynomial Representation

I modeled the trajectory as a seventh-order polynomial function of time:

$$
\mathbf{p}(t) = a_0 + a_1 t + a_2 t^2 + a_3 t^3 + a_4 t^4 + a_5 t^5 + a_6 t^6 + a_7 t^7
$$

where $\mathbf{p}(t)$ is the position vector.

### Snap Minimization Approximation

Although seventh-order polynomials are not the exact solution to the minimum snap problem, they approximate the correct solution. The reason for this is that continuity up the sixth derivative of motion is enforced at each of the intermediate waypoints. 

$$
J = \int_{0}^{T} \left( \frac{d^4 \mathbf{p}(t)}{dt^4} \right)^2 dt
$$

### Matrix System Construction

To solve for the polynomial coefficients, I constructed a matrix system based on the constraints of the trajectory. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown of how I constructed the matrix system:

#### 1. Waypoints and Segments

Given $N$ waypoints, I had $N-1$ segments. Each segment is represented by a seventh-order polynomial, which has 8 coefficients. Therefore, I had a total of $8(N-1)$ unknown coefficients to solve for.

#### 2. Constraints

To determine these coefficients, I set up a system of linear equations based on the following constraints:

- **Initial and Final Constraints**:
  - Velocity, acceleration, jerk, snap, crackle, and pop are zero at the start and end positions.

- **Waypoint Constraints**:
  - The polynomial passes through each waypoint.

- **Continuity Constraints**:
  - Continuity of position, velocity, acceleration, jerk, snap, crackle, and pop at each interior waypoint.

#### 3. Formulating the Matrix System

I denoted the normalized start times as $t_i$ for $i = 0, 1, \ldots, N-1$. I constructed the matrix $\mathbf{A}$ and vector $\mathbf{b}$ to encode these constraints:

1. **Initial Constraints**:

   - Velocity at $t_0$:
 
$$
7 t_0^6 a_7 + 6 t_0^5 a_6 + 5 t_0^4 a_5 + 4 t_0^3 a_4 + 3 t_0^2 a_3 + 2 t_0 a_2 + a_1 = 0
$$

   - Acceleration at $t_0$:

$$
42 t_0^5 a_7 + 30 t_0^4 a_6 + 20 t_0^3 a_5 + 12 t_0^2 a_4 + 6 t_0 a_3 + 2 a_2 = 0
$$

   - Jerk at $t_0$:

$$
210 t_0^4 a_7 + 120 t_0^3 a_6 + 60 t_0^2 a_5 + 24 t_0 a_4 + 6 a_3 = 0
$$

2. **Waypoint Constraints**:

   For each waypoint $\mathbf{p}_i$ at $t_i$:

$$
\mathbf{p}_i = a_0 + a_1 t_i + a_2 t_i^2 + a_3 t_i^3 + a_4 t_i^4 + a_5 t_i^5 + a_6 t_i^6 + a_7 t_i^7
$$

3. **Continuity Constraints**:

   For continuity at each interior waypoint $t_i$ (for $i = 1, 2, \ldots, N-2$):

 - Position:

$$
\mathbf{p}(t_i^-) = \mathbf{p}(t_i^+)
$$

   - Velocity:

$$
\frac{d\mathbf{p}}{dt}(t_i^-) = \frac{d\mathbf{p}}{dt}(t_i^+)
$$

   - Acceleration:

$$
\frac{d^2\mathbf{p}}{dt^2}(t_i^-) = \frac{d^2\mathbf{p}}{dt^2}(t_i^+)
$$

   - Jerk:

$$
\frac{d^3\mathbf{p}}{dt^3}(t_i^-) = \frac{d^3\mathbf{p}}{dt^3}(t_i^+)
$$

   - Snap:

$$
\frac{d^4\mathbf{p}}{dt^4}(t_i^-) = \frac{d^4\mathbf{p}}{dt^4}(t_i^+)
$$

   - Crackle:

$$
\frac{d^5\mathbf{p}}{dt^5}(t_i^-) = \frac{d^5\mathbf{p}}{dt^5}(t_i^+)
$$

   - Pop:

$$
\frac{d^6\mathbf{p}}{dt^6}(t_i^-) = \frac{d^6\mathbf{p}}{dt^6}(t_i^+)
$$

These constraints led to a system of $8(N-1)$ linear equations. I constructed the matrix $\mathbf{A}$ by placing the coefficients of the polynomials in each row corresponding to the constraints, and $\mathbf{b}$ as the vector of known values (positions of waypoints, zeros for continuity constraints).

#### Solving the System

I solved the system of equations $\mathbf{A} \mathbf{a} = \mathbf{b}$ using Eigen's `colPivHouseholderQr` solver, which provided the polynomial coefficients $\mathbf{a}$.

```cpp
Eigen::VectorXd solveCoefficients(const std::vector<Eigen::Vector3f>& waypoints, const std::vector<double>& startTimes, char component) {
    // (Implementation details...)
    return A.colPivHouseholderQr().solve(b);
}
```

#### Evaluating the Trajectory
Once I determined the coefficients, I used the evaluateTrajectory function to evaluate the polynomial at any given time $t$ to obtain the position of the trajectory.

```cpp
Eigen::Vector3f evaluateTrajectory(const Eigen::VectorXd& coeffsX, const Eigen::VectorXd& coeffsY, const Eigen::VectorXd& coeffsZ, const std::vector<double>& startTimes, double t) {
    // (Implementation details...)
    return point;
}
```

This detailed explanation illustrates how I constructed and solved the matrix system for trajectory generation to achieve smooth and efficient path planning, showcasing my comfort with both mathematical principles and programming.
